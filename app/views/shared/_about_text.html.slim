p My name is #{ link_to "Daniel Weinmann", "http://fb.com/danielweinmann", target: :_blank } and I'm the founder of Tangueros. I can't tell you how glad I am to have you here!
p I've been a tango dancer for many years now and I've also launched several web businesses, such as #{ link_to "Catarse", "https://www.catarse.me/", target: :_blank }, Brazil's first and largest crowdfunding platform.
p Now I'm pleased to share my newest creation: Tangueros, the social network for tango dancers. Here you can get in touch with dancers from all over the world while at the same time you help sustain this culture we love so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
p The main reason I started this adventure is to unite tango lovers everywhere so we can solve huge challenges while connecting and having fun! Remember that person you danced with, were amazed by the connection you two had (even fell in love a little bit), but never met again? I'm pretty sure you'll find him or her here üôå
p But we also have to talk about serious stuff once in a while. For instance, do you know that there are a lot of milongas in Buenos Aires that are striving to keep the doors open? In a near future I'll ask you to join me in a quest for helping save some of them! Do you want to be part of this movement?
p The feeling of belonging to a global community that understands its origins and at the same time spreads the seeds far and wide is one of the best things we get to feel as human beings. And our beloved tango is perfect for that! Many believe it is even a microcosm of that in every dance üòÄ
p So, just like when you're dancing, I invite you to have fun on Tangueros with a deep sense of connection. Oh, and I also have a favor to ask: #{ link_to 'can you tell everybody about Tangueros?', 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://tangueros.club/', target: :_blank } You'll have my eternal gratitude and a much cooler experience with more tangueros on board!
p Please don't hesitate to contact me at #{ mail_to "hello@tangueros.club", "hello@tangueros.club", target: :_blank } for anything. I can't wait to talk to you!
p Un abrazo,<br>Daniel Weinmann
